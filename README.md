# youtube-search-only
A Chrome extension that keeps you focused on YouTube’s homepage by hiding the distracting thumbnail grid. It replaces the main feed with a blurred block so you can still use the search bar to find exactly what you came for.

This is for those moments when you open YouTube with a specific idea to search and watch, but end up stuck on the homepage—scrolling and losing time on videos you didn’t plan to watch.

Note: This extension works only on the YouTube homepage. It does not collect user data and does not store anything. Feel free to open an issue or create a PR.
